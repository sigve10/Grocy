>[!abstract] Tag system
>I am a shopper who wishes to check which type of donut I should buy. I can filter the app by the tag donut, and then sort by customer satisfaction in order to see which donut most people enjoyed. I am also lactose intolerant, so I'd prefer to also filter by the donuts that are lactose-free.

>[!example] Barcode
>I am a shopper who is looking at a product with a very funky and hard to spell name. This is no problem though, because I can scan the barcode of the product and then the app will automatically find the product if it exists. If it does not exist, I can always add it myself and type in the product number so that people like me can easily find it in the future.

>[!info] Ratings
>I am a shopper who has just bought a Greek yoghurt and found in hindsight that it was only 2% Greek yoghurt, and the rest was just regular ice cream. The label was extremely misleading, and in order to help other people avoid that product, I give it a rating of "Not recommended" (ðŸ˜¡) for "Label accuracy" as the label led me to buy a product I did not actually want. However, for people who don't actually care whether it is Greek yoghurt, I give it a "Recommended" (ðŸ˜ƒ) in "Bang for buck" as it was way cheaper than other brands with the same quality.

>[!abstract] Reviews
>I am the same shopper who bought the Greek yoghurt, and it has come to my mind that I should probably clarify why I found the label misleading. Therefore, I leave a written review on the product in question where I explain that the Greek yoghurt was not actually Greek yoghurt. That way, when others check the product, they will see my written review alongside my rating so that they can understand why I found the label misleading. Users can also upvote or downvote my review, based on whether they agree or disagree with what I rated it. If I ever found out that my review was not entirely justified, I can always go back and delete it in order to create a new and more accurate review.

>[!example] Sorting by rating
>I am a cheapskate shopper, and I would like to buy only the cheapest products. However, I am also not fond of buying cheap products that taste horrible. Therefore, I sort the list by "Bang for buck", filter by the products I need to buy, and then look at the "Customer satisfaction" rating of each product so that I can know that I'm buying something I'll most likely enjoy.

>[!info] Wishlist system
>I am a shopper who commonly needs to buy cheese. In this case, I can add the tag "cheese" to my app wishlist, or one or more specific cheese products that I would usually buy, and then I will get a push notification whenever a product in my wishlist comes on sale. That way, I can buy cheese in bulk so that I save money.

>[!abstract] Following system
>I am a shopper who typically buys Energy Drinks. Energy drink companies typically come out with many different new tastes, and new brands pop up every now and again. I can follow the "Energy drink" tag, and then I will get a push notification whenever someone adds a new product in that category. I can also just as easily unfollow a tag as I can follow one.

>[!example] Image uploads
>I am a shopper who has just found out that I bought a juice carton that was just chockfull of large chunks of pulp. I find this disgusting, and so in order to help people understand why I gave the product a negative review, I can upload an image to the product's page in order to show people the large pieces of pulp.

>[!info] Algorithmic sorting
>I am a shopper who is looking through the list of products in order to learn what I should probably avoid or which products I should likely buy. The list of products is always weakly sorted by the amount of available reviews for that product, as well as the amount of people who have recently clicked in on the product. This way, the hottest products will always be close to the top.

>[!abstract] Pseudonym reviewer
>I am an influencer who would prefer not to have people able to see my name when I leave a review. Therefore, I can provide the app with a pseudonym or nickname and tell it to use that nickname whenever I post a review.

>[!example] Gamification
>I am a shopper who would not otherwise be motivated to leave reviews on the products I buy. However, since the application gives me fun little badges/achievements for my activity with the app, I feel motivated to leave reviews for that primitive dopamine rush my brain gets.

>[!info] Price ranges on products
>I am a shopper who would like to know whether I'm buying a product at a premium, rather than the common price. I can check this, because whenever reviewers look at a product, they can tell how much they bought it for, and whether it was on a sale, which is then neatly displayed on the product page as a price range. I can check the highest price someone has found it for, as well as the lowest non-sale price and see whether I'd be buying it extremely overpriced or extremely underpriced.
